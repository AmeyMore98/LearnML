It is used by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in any given situation. Reinforcement learning is different from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the task. In the absence of training data, it learns from its experience.</p>

The robot learns by trying all the possible paths and then selecting the path which gives him the diamond with the least hurdles. Each right step will give the robot a reward and each wrong step will subtract the reward of the robot. The total reward will be calculated when it reaches the final reward that is the diamond.</p>

			<ul>

  				<li><b>Output:</b> There are many possible outputs as there are variety of solution to a particular problem</li>
				<li><b>Training:</b> The training is based upon the input, the model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.</li>

				<p><b>Positive:</b></p><br>
				<p>Positive Reinforcement is defined as when an event, occurs due to a particular behavior, increases the strength and the frequency of the behavior.</p><br>
				<p>Advantages:</p><br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Maximizes Performance</li>
						<li>Sustain Change for a long period of time</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Disadvantages:</p><br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Too much Reinforcement can lead to overload of states which can diminish the results</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><b>Negative:</b></p><br>
					<p>
					Negative Reinforcement is defined as strengthening of a behavior because a negative condition is stopped or avoided. 
					</p><br>
					<p>Advantages:</p><br>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Increases Behavior</li>
						<li>Provide defiance to minimum standard of performance</li>

				<p>Disadvantages:</p><br>
