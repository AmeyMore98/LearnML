    <p>Logistic regression is used for classification. It gives the probability of the variable Y belonging to a certain class. A good example of classification is determining whether or not a application is fraudulent. Ultimately, the lender needs to understand whether or not they ought to provide the receiver a loan or not, and that they have some tolerance for risk that the application is really deceitful. during this case, the goal of logistic regression is to calculate the likelihood (between 0.33 and 100%) that the application is fraud. With these possibilities, we are able to set some threshold on top of that weâ€™re willing to lend to the receiver, and below that we have a tendency to deny their application or flag the application for additional review.

    const htmlContent2 = `<p>Though logistic regression is usually used for binary classification wherever there are 2 categories, keep in mind that classification is performed with any variety of classes (e.g. when assigning written digits a label between zero and nine, or using automatic face recognition to discover that friends are in a Facebook picture).</p><br>
    <p>Logistic regression can be expressed as:</p>

    Unlike simple regression model, that uses normal Least sq. for parameter estimation, we tend to use maximum likelihood Estimation. 
    There is infinite sets of regression coefficients. {the maximum|the utmost|the most} probability estimate is that set of regression coefficients for which the chance of obtaining the info we've got discovered is maximum.
    <br>For binary data, the output is pi for success and 1-pi for failure. The MLE is:
